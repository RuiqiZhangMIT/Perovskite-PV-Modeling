# Perovskite-PV-Modeling

These are the demo codes for paper  "**Machine Learning Prediction of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Solar Cell Performance from Optical Properties**â€œ. Note that this is the version during review, more materials will be uploaded officially out.

NN_Prediction.py is the file that runs the demo code video attached to the paper which contains the main Neural Network model.

NN_Prediction_Degrade.py is the sample code file with the main Neural Network model in predicting both pristine and degraded perovskite solar cells.

Regression.py is the sample code file where LR is carried out.

Classifier.py is the sample classifier code file for SVM.
